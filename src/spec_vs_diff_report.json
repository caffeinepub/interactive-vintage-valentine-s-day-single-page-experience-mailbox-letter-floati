  "summary": "The diff updates the Valentine asset reference to point to a new v2 couple illustration filename, but does not include the new image asset itself and provides no direct evidence that ScratchFrameScene is wired to render the new asset beyond the constant change. Two unrelated metadata/summary files were also modified without being requested.",

      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Add/replace the scratch-off revealed couple illustration with a new comic-like selfie image matching the specified couple details, saved as a new static asset under frontend/public/assets/generated with the agreed filename and dimensions.",
      "reason": "No new image file was added in the diff (Added: 0), so there is no evidence the required new static asset actually exists under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary: \"Added: 0\"",
        "frontend/src/components/valentine/assets.ts (references /assets/generated/couple-illustration-v2.dim_1400x1000.png but does not add the file)"

      "requirement": "Ensure ScratchFrameScene displays the newly replaced couple illustration (not cached/previous) by updating the asset reference used by ScratchFrameScene (via frontend/src/components/valentine/assets.ts).",
      "reason": "While assets.ts is updated to the new filename, the diff does not show any ScratchFrameScene change or usage proving it renders ASSETS.coupleIllustration from that path (beyond a narrative in a separate summary file).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/valentine/assets.ts",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions ScratchFrameScene displays updated illustration, but is not actual implementation code)"
