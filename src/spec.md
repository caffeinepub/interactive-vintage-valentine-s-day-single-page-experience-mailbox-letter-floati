# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix broken scrolling/progression, make the Valentine letter readable on all devices, and shift the experience’s visual style from moody/vintage to fun and playful.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix single-page scroll behavior so users can always move through mailbox/letter → movie ticket → scratch frame on desktop and mobile, before and after interactions complete.
- Improve the letter’s layout, sizing, and contrast to ensure the full message is comfortably readable across viewports while preserving the exact `LETTER_CONTENT` text (including line breaks and emojis).
- Update global and scene styles to remove heavy vintage cues and apply a bright, fun/playful Valentine theme consistently across all scenes.
- Make the “Scroll to continue” UX reliable (and only shown when progression is actually possible), with dependable progression after completing the letter and ticket steps.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can scroll smoothly through the entire Valentine experience on any device, read the full letter clearly, and enjoy a consistently fun/playful Valentine look and feel with reliable prompts to continue.
