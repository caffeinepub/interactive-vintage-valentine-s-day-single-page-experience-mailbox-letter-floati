export const LETTER_CONTENT = `Hi bestie, happy Valentine's Day ❤️

I love you and I need you to know how truly special you are not just to me but to this world. You have so much potential, so much light in you and I honestly can't wait to see all the amazing things you're going to accomplish and the changes you're going to make. I believe in you more than you even realize.

I admire your heart, your mind, the way you think and you inspire me in so many ways. Even from far away, you make my days better, lighter, and happier. Just hearing from you and hearing your cute (hyena sounding) laugh can turn my whole mood around.

I never want to see you doubt yourself or feel like you're not enough, because you are more than enough. On the days you feel tired, overwhelmed, or unsure, I hope you remember that I'm always in your corner. I'm always cheering for you, always and forever no matter where you are in life.

The distance is hard sometimes but I'm grateful for you.

I can't wait to see you again and until then, just know I'm always here.

From: your oompa loompa 🤍`;
